## ðŸ“š Project Overview

In this project, we explore alternative portfolio optimization methods: **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)** and **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)**.
These approaches are considered more robust because they do not assume any specific distribution of asset returns. Moreover, they allow us to evaluate portfolio risk from different perspectivesâ€”particularly focusing on *absolute deviation* and *worst-case loss*.

Specifically:

- **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**:
Constructs a portfolio whose returns deviate as little as possible from a target expected return, measured using absolute deviations over all time periods.

- **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)**:
Builds a portfolio that minimizes the maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough over a given period, subject to a predefined risk threshold.
## ðŸš€ Repository Structure

- **Images**: Contains all images used in the notebook.

- **Theory**: A PDF document providing a detailed explanation of the theory behind the models.

- **MAD & MDD Portfolio Optimization.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that explains both methods and demonstrates the optimization process.
